## Hi there 👋

I'm Liannaka, a data driven and full stack engineer based in India.

I can design, create logic, envision and build things.

If an idea pops into my mind, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is node.js, html, css, javascript, mySQL. My favorite tools are vscode and canva.

I've got a freelance project to work upon, with a satisfied client.
